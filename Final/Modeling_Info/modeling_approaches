### Modeling Approaches Detailed in the Project

This project employs a variety of modeling techniques, each tailored to the specific nuances of the datasets and research questions. Below is a detailed breakdown of the methodologies:

---

#### **1. Logistic Regression**

**Purpose**: To predict binary outcomes (e.g., peptide activity classification or cancer diagnosis) by modeling the relationship between input features and a log-odds ratio.

**Key Features**:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Applied scaling to ensure features were normalized.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Regularization strength (`C`) and solver (`liblinear`, `lbfgs`) optimized using GridSearchCV.
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - **Accuracy**: Proportion of correct predictions.
  - **F1 Score**: Balance between precision and recall.
  - **ROC-AUC**: Ability to distinguish between classes.

**Results**:
- Excellent performance on peptide datasets due to distinct feature separations.
- Struggled on lung cancer datasets where feature overlaps reduced classification effectiveness.

#### **2. Random Forest**

**Purpose**: To handle non-linear relationships and complex feature interactions for classification tasks.

**Key Features**:
- **Ensemble Learning**: Combines predictions from multiple decision trees.
- **Feature Importance**: Helps identify key predictors in datasets.
- **Hyperparameter Optimization**: `n_estimators`, `max_depth`, and `min_samples_split` fine-tuned.

**Evaluation Metrics**:
- Similar to Logistic Regression, with additional analysis of feature importances.

**Results**:
- Strong classification on peptide datasets.
- Encountered challenges in distinguishing between lung cancer stages due to noisy or overlapping features.

#### **3. Gradient Boosting**

**Purpose**: To iteratively refine predictions by minimizing residual errors in the dataset.

**Key Features**:
- **Learning Rate**: Controls the contribution of each tree.
- **Number of Estimators**: Optimized for performance without overfitting.
- **Max Depth**: Restricts tree complexity to prevent overfitting.

**Evaluation Metrics**:
- Accuracy, F1 Score, ROC-AUC for classification.
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R² for regression.

**Results**:
- Achieved near-perfect results on breast cancer datasets.
- Gradient Boosting stood out as the best performer for survival months regression in the lung cancer dataset.

#### **4. Voting Classifier**

**Purpose**: To leverage the strengths of multiple models for improved robustness and accuracy.

**Key Features**:
- **Soft Voting**: Weighted probabilities from Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting combined to predict classes.
- **Enhanced Generalizability**: Improved performance by integrating predictions from different perspectives.

**Evaluation Metrics**:
- Accuracy, F1 Score, and ROC-AUC across datasets.

**Results**:
- Enhanced robustness in peptide dataset predictions.
- Comparable performance on lung cancer datasets to individual models, showing slight improvement in stability.

#### **5. Linear Regression**

**Purpose**: To model continuous outcomes (e.g., survival months) and analyze relationships between predictors and a target variable.

**Key Features**:
- **Multicollinearity Management**: Features standardized to ensure comparability.
- **Residual Analysis**: Assessed model fit and patterns in errors.

**Evaluation Metrics**:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures average magnitude of errors.
- R² Score: Indicates the proportion of variance explained by the model.

**Results**:
- Gradient Boosting Regressor surpassed Linear Regression in accuracy but Linear Regression provided interpretable insights.
