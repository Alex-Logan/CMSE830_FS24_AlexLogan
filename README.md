# CMSE830_FS24_AlexLogan

This repository is where my project work lives for CMSE 830 (Foundations of Data Science) at Michigan State University. You'll find two base folders here: one for the Midterm project, and one for the Final. Currently, there is only the Midterm project, which involves cancer research, specifically in the observing of the possible anticancer effects of certain peptides and what cancer-causing factors they might help fight. My final project, tentatively, is planned to continue this, but that is subject to change.

IMPORTANT NOTE: There are more detailed README files in the appropriate folders (read: there is right now for the Midterm, and there will be for the final when this repo is complete). Importantly, you can find the project's overview and setup instructions in the secondary README file found in the appropriate folder.

This is done for organization's sake.
