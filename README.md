# CMSE830_FS24_AlexLogan

This repository is where my project work lives for CMSE 830 (Foundations of Data Science) at Michigan State University. You'll find two base folders here: one for the Midterm project, and one for the Final. Currently, there is only the Midterm project, which involves cancer research, specifically in the observing of the possible anticancer effects of certain peptides and what cancer-causing factors they might help fight. My final project, tentatively, is planned to continue this.

More specific information can be found inside the project folder(s).
