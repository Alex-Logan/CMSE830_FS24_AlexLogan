# CMSE830_FS24_AlexLogan

Welcome to my project repository for CMSE 830 (Foundations of Data Science) at Michigan State University. This repository contains two main folders: one for the Midterm project and another for the Final project. The Midterm and Final projects both focus on cancer research—specifically, exploring the potential anticancer effects of certain peptides. The Midterm project explored this for breast cancer- the Final is a more comprehensive study that includes the research from the Midterm alongisde additional research for Lung Cancer.

### Project Focus

In this project, I investigate the following:

- The specific acids within peptides that may be most important in combating cancer.
- The cancerous factors that these peptides might help fight.
- The attributes that characterize the "best" anticancer peptides.

## Important Notes

- There are more detailed README files in the respective project folders. For each project (Midterm and Final), a secondary README file contains an overview and setup instructions. However, now that the Final project is complete, the Midterm project is somewhat irrelevant to setup and run outside of archival purposes.
- This structure is designed for better organization and clarity.

Feel free to explore the repository, and don’t hesitate to reach out to loganal2@msu.edu if you have any questions!
